# High-end Slurm Cluster Configuration
# This configuration describes a powerful research-grade Slurm cluster

# Cluster Specification
nodes: 16                     # Number of nodes in the cluster
node_type: "highend_gpu"      # Type of nodes (basic_cpu, basic_gpu, highend_gpu, jetson_cluster, custom)
power_cost: 0.11              # Cost per kWh in USD (lower due to bulk rate)
amortization_period: 1095     # Hardware amortization period in days (3 years)
maintenance_factor: 0.12      # Annual maintenance cost as fraction of hardware cost
utilization_factor: 0.85      # Average cluster utilization (higher for a research cluster)
network_cost: 25000.0         # Network infrastructure cost (USD)
admin_cost_per_year: 120000.0 # System administrator cost per year (USD)
currency: "USD"

# Note: Since we're using a predefined node type (highend_gpu), the following 
# node configuration is informational only - it matches what's defined in the system.
# These values are used automatically:
#
