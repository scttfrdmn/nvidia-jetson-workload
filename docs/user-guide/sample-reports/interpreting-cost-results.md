This guide explains how to interpret the cost comparison metrics and visualizations generated by the NVIDIA Jetson Workload suite, helping you extract actionable insights from the cost analysis.

## Understanding Key Metrics

### Total Cost

The total cost metric represents the complete cost of executing a workload on a specific computing environment. It includes:

- **Hardware amortization**: The portion of hardware cost allocated to this execution
- **Operational costs**: Power, maintenance, and administration
- **Instance costs**: For cloud providers, the cost of VM instances and associated resources

Example interpretation:
```
Workload: N-body simulation with 100K particles
Execution time: 53.4 seconds
Total costs:
- Jetson Orin NX: $0.00035
- AWS g4dn.xlarge: $0.13819
- DGX A100: $0.77763
```

**Key insight**: The Jetson costs approximately 400 times less than AWS and 2,200 times less than a DGX A100 for this specific workload.

### Cost Efficiency (Operations per Dollar)

Cost efficiency measures how many operations you can perform per dollar spent. Higher values indicate better efficiency.

```
Cost Efficiency = Throughput × Execution Time / Total Cost
```

Example interpretation:
```
Workload: N-body simulation with 100K particles
Throughput: 18.7 iterations/second
Cost efficiency:
- Jetson Orin NX: 2,852,371 operations/$
- AWS g4dn.xlarge: 7,227 operations/$
- DGX A100: 1,284 operations/$
```

**Key insight**: The Jetson Orin NX can perform 395 times more operations per dollar than AWS and 2,222 times more than a DGX A100 for this specific workload.

### Cost Ratio

The cost ratio directly compares the cost of cloud or enterprise solutions to local Jetson computing. Values greater than 1.0 indicate that Jetson is more cost-effective.

```
Cost Ratio = Alternative Cost / Jetson Cost
```

Example interpretation:
```
Cloud cost ratios:
- AWS/Jetson: 394.8x
- Azure/Jetson: 397.9x
- GCP/Jetson: 390.6x

Enterprise cost ratios:
- DGX A100/Jetson: 2,221.8x
- Slurm Cluster/Jetson: 7.8x
```

**Key insight**: For this workload, all alternatives are more expensive than Jetson, with cloud options being ~400x more expensive and enterprise options ranging from 8x to 2,200x more expensive.

### Break-Even Analysis

Break-even analysis shows how many hours of operation are required before the upfront cost of Jetson hardware is offset by savings compared to alternatives.

```
Break-Even Hours = Jetson Hardware Cost / (Alternative Hourly Cost - Jetson Hourly Cost)
```

Example interpretation:
```
Break-even hours:
- AWS: 926 hours (38.6 days of continuous operation)
- Azure: 942 hours (39.3 days)
- GCP: 913 hours (38.0 days)
- DGX A100: 7,426 hours (309 days)
```

**Key insight**: If you run workloads more than ~40 days cumulatively, Jetson becomes more economical than cloud options. For DGX systems, the break-even point is around 10 months.

## Interpreting Visualizations

### Cost Comparison Chart

![Cost Comparison Chart](../images/sample-cost-comparison.png)

This chart shows absolute costs for each computing environment across different workloads.

**How to interpret**:
- Compare the height of bars within each workload group
- Look for consistent patterns across workloads
- Identify which environments are most cost-effective for each specific workload

**Decision insights**:
- If Jetson bars are consistently the shortest, local computing is likely more economical
- If there's significant variation across workloads, your workload characteristics matter greatly for cost efficiency

### Enterprise Comparison Chart

![Enterprise Comparison Chart](../images/sample-enterprise-comparison.png)

This visualization compares Jetson against enterprise-grade solutions like DGX systems and Slurm clusters.

**How to interpret**:
- The top panel shows absolute costs
- The bottom panel shows cost ratios relative to Jetson
- The horizontal red line in the bottom panel indicates equal cost (ratio = 1.0)

**Decision insights**:
- Bars above the red line indicate options more expensive than Jetson
- Shorter bars in the top panel represent more cost-effective options
- Compare cost ratios to determine the premium you're paying for enterprise solutions

### System Scaling Analysis

![System Scaling Analysis](../images/sample-system-scaling.png)

This visualization shows how costs scale with system size for different hardware configurations.

**How to interpret**:
- Each subplot represents a different system type
- Points represent specific workloads
- The slope of the trendline indicates how much cost increases per additional node/GPU
- Steeper slopes indicate higher marginal costs as you scale

**Decision insights**:
- Flatter slopes indicate better economies of scale
- Compare slopes to determine which system types scale most efficiently
- Use this to project costs for larger deployments

### Break-Even Analysis Chart

![Break-Even Analysis](../images/sample-break-even.png)

This chart shows how quickly local hardware investments pay off compared to cloud alternatives.

**How to interpret**:
- Each bar represents the hours required to reach break-even for a specific cloud provider
- Bars marked with "∞" indicate that break-even is never reached (cloud is always cheaper)
- Shorter bars indicate faster return on investment

**Decision insights**:
- Break-even times under 30 days (720 hours) strongly favor local computing
- Break-even times over 1 year (8,760 hours) favor cloud computing unless you plan very long-term use
- The variation across workloads indicates which workload types best justify local investment

## Practical Decision Framework

Use this framework to interpret cost comparison results and make infrastructure decisions:

1. **Determine usage pattern**:
   - **Occasional**: Less than 20 hours per week
   - **Regular**: 20-80 hours per week
   - **Heavy**: 80+ hours per week
   - **Continuous**: 24/7 operation

2. **Compare break-even times to your usage pattern**:
   - If you'll exceed the break-even hours within 3-6 months, local computing is likely more economical
   - If not, cloud computing may be preferable

3. **Consider performance requirements**:
   - If you need results quickly, look beyond cost to execution time
   - For time-critical workloads, higher-end hardware may justify the premium

4. **Evaluate operational factors**:
   - Hardware management overhead
   - Deployment timeline
   - Data security requirements
   - Scaling flexibility

5. **Calculate total cost of ownership (TCO)**:
   - Combine break-even analysis with projected usage
   - Account for non-quantified factors like maintenance effort
   - Project costs over your planning horizon (typically 3 years)

## Example Decision Process

Using the cost comparison results for N-body simulation:

1. **Usage pattern**: The team runs simulations 30 hours per week (1,560 hours per year)

2. **Break-even analysis**:
   - AWS break-even: 926 hours (reached after 31 weeks)
   - This is within the first year, suggesting Jetson is more economical

3. **Performance evaluation**:
   - Jetson execution time: 53.4 seconds
   - AWS execution time: 48.2 seconds
   - The performance difference is minimal (AWS is 10% faster)

4. **Operational factors**:
   - Team has local IT support
   - Data can remain on-premises
   - No immediate scaling needs

5. **TCO calculation**:
   - Jetson: $599 + ($0.00875 × 1,560) = $612.65 per year
   - AWS: $0.65558 × 1,560 = $1,022.70 per year
   - Savings with Jetson: $410.05 per year (40% less expensive)

**Decision**: Purchase Jetson Orin NX for local computing, as it provides 40% cost savings with minimal performance impact and aligns with operational requirements.

## Conclusion

The cost comparison feature provides comprehensive data to support infrastructure decisions, but interpretation requires considering your specific usage patterns and requirements. By understanding the metrics and visualizations, you can extract actionable insights that balance cost efficiency with performance needs, operational constraints, and long-term planning.
